\subsection*{Word Problems}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]

\item \textbf{Compound Interest:} How long will it take for an investment to triple if invested at an annual rate of 8.8\% compounded weekly? 

\item \textbf{Sound Intensity:} The decibel level of a sound is given by $L = 10\log\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right)$, in dB,  where $I$ is the intensity of the sound, in W/m$^2$,  and $I_0 = 10^{-12}$ W/m$^2$ is the threshold of hearing. If a rock concert measures 115 dB, what is the intensity of the sound?

\item \textbf{Radioactive Decay:} Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years. If a fossil contains 30\% of its original Carbon-14, how old is the fossil? Use the formula $N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt}$ where $N_0$ is the amount of original sample, $k$ is the radio active decay constant, and $t$ is time in years. 

\item \textbf{Population Growth:} A city's population grows according to $P(t) = P_0 e^{0.025t}$, where $t$ is in years, and $P_0$ is the initial population. How long will it take for the population to triple?

\item \textbf{Compound Interest:} An investment of \$5,000 earns 6\% annual interest compounded monthly. How long will it take for the investment to grow to \$8,000? Use $A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$.

\item \textbf{Sound Intensity:} A library has a noise level of 40 dB and a busy street has a noise level of 70 dB. How many times more intense is the sound on the busy street compared to the library?

\item \textbf{Radioactive Decay:} Plutonium-239 has a half-life of 24,100 years. How long will it take for a sample to decay to 10\% of its original amount?

\item \textbf{Logistic Growth:} A population of bacteria grows according to $P(t) = \frac{5000}{1 + 49e^{-0.8t}}$, where $t$ is in hours. How long will it take for the population to reach 4,000?

\item \textbf{Compound Interest:} You invest \$10,000 at 4.5\% annual interest. Compare the time it takes to double your money when compounded (a) annually, (b) quarterly, and (c) continuously (use $A = Pe^{rt}$ for continuous compounding and $A=P\left(1+\dfrac{r}{n}\right)^{rt}$.

\item \textbf{Population Growth:} The population of a town was 25,000 in 2010 and 32,000 in 2020. Assuming exponential growth $P(t) = P_0 e^{kt}$, what will the population be in 2030?


\item \textbf{Sound Intensity:} The sound intensity level increases by 3 dB. By what factor does the actual intensity increase?

\item \textbf{Radioactive Decay:} Iodine-131 is used in medical treatments and has a half-life of 8 days. A patient receives a 50 mCi dose. How long will it take for the radioactivity to decrease to a safe level of 2 mCi?


\item \textbf{Compound Interest:} Which investment will grow faster: \$5,000 at 7\% compounded quarterly or \$5,000 at 6.9\% compounded continuously? Calculate the value of each after 10 years.

\item \textbf{Logistic Growth:} A fish population in a lake follows the logistic model $P(t) = \frac{8000}{1 + 15e^{-0.5t}}$, where $t$ is in years. When will the population reach 6,000 fish?

\item \textbf{pH Levels:} The pH of a solution is given by $\text{pH} = -\log[H^+]$, where $[H^+]$ is the hydrogen ion concentration in moles per liter. If a solution has a pH of 3.5, what is the hydrogen ion concentration?

\item \textbf{Population Growth:} A bacteria culture doubles every 3 hours. If there are initially 500 bacteria, how long will it take to reach 50,000 bacteria?

\item \textbf{Compound Interest:} An investment earns 5.5\% annual interest compounded daily (365 days). How much should you invest now to have \$25,000 in 8 years? 

\item \textbf{Sound Intensity:} Two sounds have intensities $I_1$ and $I_2$, where $I_2 = 100 I_1$. What is the difference in their decibel levels?

\item \textbf{Radioactive Decay:} Strontium-90 has a half-life of 28.8 years. If a sample contains 80 grams initially, how much will remain after 50 years?

\item \textbf{Logistic Growth:} A rumor spreads through a school of 2,000 students according to $N(t) = \frac{2000}{1 + 1999e^{-0.6t}}$, where $t$ is in days. How long will it take for 1,500 students to hear the rumor?

\item \textbf{Compound Interest:} You have \$20,000 to invest. Bank A offers 6.2\% compounded monthly, and Bank B offers 6\% compounded continuously. Which bank will give you more money after 15 years, and by how much?
