% Dear Teachers and Students,\\


% \noindent
% This booklet offers problems on systems of equations with two and three variables. The "solutions" and video packages include graphing, substitution, elimination, and matrix methods such as Cramer's Rule and row operations, just to name a couple. To maximize your learning, try solving the problems before reviewing the solutions. This approach will enhance your aptitude in the subject matter and better prepare you for both in-class and standardized tests.\\

% \noindent
% Additionally, a video solutions package is available, featuring 10 solved problems that are representative of the problem set in this booklet. In these videos, we thoroughly work through each problem and explain my approach to finding the solution.\\
% \noindent


% Please note that this worksheet is designed for practice and reinforcement, not as an initial lesson on the material. We assume that you are already familiar with these concepts from lectures and classes. The purpose of these problems is to help you solidify your understanding and master the material through varied difficulty levels.\\

% \noindent
% Thank you for supporting our work. We hope that you find this resource valuable. Please share your feedback and suggestions with us using the form provided on our page.\\
